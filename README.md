# Budget-Tracker
This project is a Progressive Web Application that can be used both on and offline to track your budget. Users are able to keep track of their budget by adding or subtracting funds from their budget. This application includes a graph so users can visually track their budget. 

## Motivation
I created this application so that users can keep track of their budget whether they have an internet connection or not. 

## Deployed Application

## Features
As a Progessive Web App, this application can be used both on and offline. If the user adds data while offline, when they are connected to the internet again that data will be added to the database. 

## Installation
If you wish to run this application locally you can clone the repository [here](https://github.com/liambambery23/Budget-Tracker). Then, install the node modules using 'npm install'. After the modules are installed, use the command 'npm start' to start the server. The application runs locally on localhost:3000
